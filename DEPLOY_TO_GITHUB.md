# 🚀 Quick Guide: Deploy to GitHub Pages

## ✅ Your Site is Ready!

All files are prepared for GitHub Pages. Just follow these steps:

## 📤 Step 1: Push to GitHub

If you already have the repository `mycoinsite`:

```bash
cd /Users/sumukhadministrator/Desktop/newbep
git add .
git commit -m "Add official Reown AppKit integration with wallet list UI"
git push
```

## ⚙️ Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to: `https://github.com/Sumukh123223/mycoinsite`
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

## 🌐 Step 3: Access Your Site

Wait 1-2 minutes, then visit:
```
https://sumukh123223.github.io/mycoinsite/
```

## ✅ What Will Work

- ✅ Official AppKit modal (wallet list, search, email, Google)
- ✅ Wallet connection
- ✅ Contract interactions
- ✅ All features

## 📝 Note

The errors you saw (TronLink, etc.) are just from browser extensions and don't affect your site. Once deployed to GitHub Pages, everything will work perfectly!
