# ✅ Which Option to Select from Reown Dashboard

## 🎯 Answer: Select "JavaScript"

You should select the **"JavaScript"** option from the dashboard.

### Why JavaScript?

- ✅ Vanilla JavaScript (no React/npm required)
- ✅ Works directly in browser
- ✅ No build tools needed
- ✅ Matches your current setup

### What You'll Get

When you click "JavaScript", you'll get:
- Vanilla JavaScript implementation guide
- CDN-based setup instructions
- Examples for browser usage
- Works with your current `index.html` setup

### ⚠️ Do NOT Select:

- ❌ React - Requires React/npm
- ❌ Next.JS - Requires Next.js/npm
- ❌ Vue - Requires Vue/npm
- ❌ Other frameworks - All require npm/build tools

---

**Select: "JavaScript"** ✅

This will show you the vanilla JavaScript implementation that works without npm/build tools, just like what we've set up!
